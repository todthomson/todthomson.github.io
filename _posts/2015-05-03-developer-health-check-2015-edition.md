title: Developer Health Check (2015 Edition)
description: |
    Last month I presented my Developer Health Check (2015 Edition)
    at the Brisbane Software Improvement Group.
    There is no video or audio for the presentation,
    but I thought I'd make the slide deck available in any case.

Last month I presented my
[Developer Health Check (2015 Edition)](http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Software-Improvement-Group/events/220574022/)
at the
[Brisbane Software Improvement Group](http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Software-Improvement-Group/).

There's no video or audio for the presentation,
but I thought make the
[__slide deck available on Speaker Deck__](https://speakerdeck.com/todthomson/developer-health-check-2015-edition)
in any case.

As always please drop me a
